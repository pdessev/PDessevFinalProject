This week I made the functional diagram for the program, wrote two unit tests, added two risks to the risk register, made my task table, wrote the summary for the week, and wrote this report.

# Summary
I have completed 4.3% of my estimated work (1 estimated for the work completed thus far, divided by 35hr total estimate) in 4.3% of the budgeted total-project time. (1.5 time spent, of 35hr total estimate).Â  For the work that has been completed, I took 1.5 (1.5/1) as much time as I estimated.
